In this assignment, we created an application that takes a user's on hand ingredients and retrieves data from two APIs: Nutrition (at edamam) and recipes (at Spoonacular). The app then displays nutrition information and recipes based on the users ingredients.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

The app fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript and writing items dynamically to the DOM, the assignment also taught us to work with two new APIs. 
HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

Enter in the ingredients you have and the amount of each ingredient. Then either click to find recipes or click find nutrition to display nitrition information. The recipes will first just display the photo and name. Once you click on the image it'll display a modal with the recipe.
